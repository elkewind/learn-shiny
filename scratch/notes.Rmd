## What is Shiny?

Interactive web pages built by people who love to code in R

Shiny makes building web apps easy

### Anatomy

UI + Server = App

Widgets are web elements that users can interact with via the UI

Reactivity:

1.  Widget gets info from user
2.  Update df used to create outputs based on user choice
3.  Create updated outputs from new df
4.  Render that ouput in the UI

### Getting Started

Shiny comes with some examples that display source code

```{r}
library(shiny)
runExample(example = NA)
runExample(example = "01_hello")
```

Note: app.R file gets really long and unruly, so splitting it up may be best

### Single file apps

Need ui section, server section, combined section

Used tags\$... to stylize

Inputs and outputs: functions for each

eg. sliderInput, plotOutput

Output functions have corresponding render functions

Reactive data frames need to be followed by ()

### Steps for Creating Reactivity

1.  Add an input to the UI (Xinput())
2.  Add an output to the UI (Xoutput())
3.  Tell the server how to assemble inputs into outputs

**Rules:**

1.  Save objects you want to display to output\$\<id\>
2.  Build reactive objects using a renderX() function
3.  access input values with input\$\<id\>

### Two file apps

global.R file can help keep code organized, reduce redundant code, increase speed, etc. It houses

-   packages

-   importing data

-   sourcing scripts

-   data wrangling

-   building custom ggplot themes

-   etc.

Use layout functions, sometimes nested, refer to resources to construct

Can use package ARTofR to stay organized
